# Hacker101 Encrypted Pastebin

This project is a collection of cryptography challenges and solutions inspired by the [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) and [Hacker101](https://www.hacker101.com/) learning resources. It is implemented in Rust and covers a variety of classic cryptographic attacks and techniques, including:

- Hex/Base64 encoding and decoding
- XOR ciphers (single-byte, repeating-key)
- Hamming distance calculation
- AES ECB and CBC mode encryption/decryption
- PKCS#7 padding
- Block transposition and analysis

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** and install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already.
2. Run the tests to see the cryptography challenges and their solutions:
   ```sh
   cargo test
   ```
3. Explore the `src/main.rs` file for detailed implementations and comments.

## Learning Path

- Start by reading the code and comments in `src/main.rs`.
- Each test function demonstrates a cryptographic concept or attack.
- Try modifying the code or adding your own tests to deepen your understanding.
- Use the references below to learn more about each topic.
